        <p>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
        middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making
        this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of
        model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
        free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give
        you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
        master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but
        because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor
        again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
        occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right
        to find fault with a man</p>
